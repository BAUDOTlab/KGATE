# Knowledge Graph Autoencoder Training Environment (KGATE)

KGATE is a knowledge graph embedding library bridging the encoders from [Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) and the decoders from [TorchKGE](https://github.com/torchkge-team/torchkge).

This tool relies heavily on the performances of TorchKGE and its numerous implemented modules for link prediction, negative sampling and model evaluation. The main goal here is to address the lack of encoders in the original library, who is unfortunately not maintained anymore.
