# KGATE's Knowledge Graph Object

KGATE uses its own `KnowledgeGraph` class, inspired by [TorchKGE](https://github.com/torchkge-team/torchkge)'s own [KnowledgeGraph](https://github.com/torchkge-team/torchkge/blob/master/torchkge/data_structures.py) class. However, our data structure is compatible with [Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric)'s representation format.

```{currentmodule} kgate.knowledgegraph
